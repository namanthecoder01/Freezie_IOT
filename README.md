**AI-Powered Smart Waste Collection System**

🚛♻ Optimizing Waste Collection with AI, IoT & Real-Time Data

📌 Team: Freezie

**🌍 Problem Statement**

Traditional waste collection systems follow fixed routes and schedules, leading to inefficiencies such as:

- Collecting empty bins while ignoring overflowing ones.

- High fuel consumption & CO₂ emissions.

- Increased operational costs.

- Lack of real-time monitoring and AI-driven prioritization.

**💡 Solution: AI-Driven Smart Waste Collection System**

A real-time waste management system that optimizes collection routes based on bin fill levels, traffic conditions, and priority.

**⚙ How It Works**

1️⃣ Smart Waste Bins with IoT Sensors

- Ultrasonic sensors measure bin fill levels.

- Tilt sensors detect movement or tampering.

- Temperature & humidity sensors monitor decomposition risks.

- GPS tracking for bin locations.

- Wireless data transmission via ESP32 WROOM32.

2️⃣ Cloud-Based Data Processing

- Data is sent to Firebase in real-time.

- AI algorithms analyze fill levels, prioritize bins & predict waste trends.

3️⃣ AI-Driven Route Optimization

- Dijkstra’s Algorithm dynamically generate an optimal collection route.

- Considers bin fill level, real-time traffic, and truck capacity.

- Sends optimized routes to the driver.

4️⃣ Worker's view for Real-Time Navigation

- Provides dynamic route updates.

- Displays missed collection alerts & estimated arrival times.

5️⃣ Admin Dashboard for Monitoring

Streamlit-based Dashboard allows:

- Live monitoring of bin status, truck locations & efficiency reports.

- Dynamic bin assignments to the nearest available van.

- Task assignment to field workers.

- Environmental impact analytics and carbon footprint reports.

🎯 Key Features

✅ AI-Optimized Routing → Reduces fuel consumption & travel time.

✅ IoT-Based Smart Bins → Avoids unnecessary collections.

✅ Real-time Monitoring → Alerts for overflowing bins.

✅ Driver App → Dynamic routing with voice guidance.

**📊 Expected Impact & Benefits**

🚀 50% Increase in Operational Efficiency – Smarter routing, reduced delays.

⛽ 30-40% Lower Fuel Costs – Optimized routes reduce fuel usage.

🏙 Cleaner Cities – Faster waste collection prevents overflow.

🌱 Lower CO₂ Emissions – Less fuel consumption, greener environment.

**🛠 How to Build the Prototype**

1️⃣ Hardware Setup (IoT)

- Use an Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)  for bin fill detection.

- Connect it to an ESP32 WROOM32 and send data to Firebase.

- Use LoRaWAN or Wi-Fi for communication.

2️⃣ AI Algorithm (Route Optimization)

- Implement Dijikstra's Algorithm for vehicle routing problems (VRP).

- Input: Bin fill levels + Traffic data + Truck capacity.

- Output: Optimized collection path.

3️⃣ Web Dashboard (Admin Panel)

Built with Streamlit.

Displays:

- Live bin status, truck tracking, analytics reports.

- Worker management with assignment functionality.

- Route optimization visualization using Folium.

4️⃣ Twilio Integration for Real-Time Alerts

Sends SMS notifications to drivers and workers.

Alerts for:

- Assigned bins to collection vans.

- Emergency notifications (fire, overflow, tilt detection).
